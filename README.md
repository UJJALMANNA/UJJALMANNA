Online test proctoring refers to the use of technology to monitor and supervise students taking tests or exams remotely. It is a way to prevent cheating and maintain the integrity of online assessments.

Online test proctoring involves using software or tools that enable a proctor or invigilator to observe and monitor students while they take tests remotely. The proctor can view the test-taker's screen, webcam, and microphone to ensure that the test is taken in a secure and fair manner.

Some common features of online test proctoring tools include:

Webcam monitoring: The proctor can see the test-taker's face and surroundings to ensure that no one else is present in the room or attempting to assist the test-taker.
Screen sharing: The proctor can view the test-taker's screen to ensure that they are not using any unauthorized materials or accessing other websites or programs during the test.
Audio monitoring: The proctor can listen to the test-taker's microphone to ensure that they are not receiving any assistance or collaborating with others during the test.
Online test proctoring is often used in educational institutions and professional certification programs to ensure that exams are taken fairly and honestly, even when students are not physically present in the same location as the proctor or instructor. <br/> <br/>
In addition to that, we conducted a survey among our teachers where we found that teachers give more than 40% of their time to creating questions for various class tests, assignments and exams. So this teacher's day, we wanted to help them out. For this, we came up with crowdsourcing question bank idea. Anyone across the world can now help teachers make questions. <br/> <strong>By everyone, for teachers!❤</strong>
